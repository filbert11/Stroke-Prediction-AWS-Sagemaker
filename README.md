AWS Sagemaker is used to create a Machine Learning Engineering pipeline (AWS pipeline) to predict Stroke.

The pipeline consists of:
1. Data pre-processing
2. Model Tuning
3. Model Evaluation
4. Condition Check:
   4.1 Model bias check
   4.2 Model explanability check
6. Model Registration
7. Deploy Lambda Step
